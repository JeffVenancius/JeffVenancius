### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've started to code for a game on the Godot Engine and fell in love with coding, so since then I'm very curious about it.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Rocket Seat Discover course.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Ghosts Of Blue (a sim life made in Godot), Kyxel (pixel art tool based on vim), Godot Body Builder (a scanner that can maybe optimize Godot builds for size).
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm aspiring to work as a front/back end developer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Used to write for Proibido Ler - a geek blog.

Also TheCowOhBoy (where I mostly go about when doing videoo games.)
